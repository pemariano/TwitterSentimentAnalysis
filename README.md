# TwitterSentimentAnalysis
This project aims to check consumers opinions of a determined product or subject in Twitter. \
It is important to understand consumers opinions and redirect the brand in the best possible direction based on the data of clients feelings. \
I accomplish that by twitter extraction with tweepy and doing sentiment analysis with textblob.

# Code
The code consists of a class for the interaction with the twitter API. 
Filtering the tweets by a query. 
Cleaning of the tweets with regex statements.
Sentiment analysis with textblob library.
Output of the results consisting of the percentages of the sentiments.

# Next Steps
One problem encountered during the developing of this code is the change in the Twitter access. to get v2 and retrieve tweets you need a paid developer account. Before you could do that with a free version.
